# File Encrypter Project
In this project we will build a simple tool that allows us to encrypt and decrypt files, we will use XOR Cipher as our encryption(and decryption) algorithm.

# Overview
- In this script we will use python3.
- This encryption tool should be applied by running a command that accepts 3 arguments, the file/folder name, the key, and optionally the output file/folder.
- When the input is a folder, the structure of the input should be respected. The output folder structure should be the same as the input and the subfolders.

# Usage
The following python packages should be installed.
os
sys
glob
Crypto.Cipher

To run this script : python3 ./xor.py secret_file.txt think-it123 output_file.txt
Where secret_file.txt is the input file that will be encrypted with the key ‘think-it123’ and saved into the file output_file.txt.

python3 ./xor.py SOURCE_FOLDER think-it123 DESTINATION_FOLDER
