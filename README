# File Encrypter Project
In this project we will build a simple tool that allows us to encrypt and decrypt files, we will use XOR Cipher as our encryption(and decryption) algorithm.

# Overview
- In this script we will use python3.
- This encryption tool should be applied by running a command that accepts 3 arguments, the file/folder name, the key, and optionally the output file/folder.
- When the input is a folder, the structure of the input should be respected. The output folder structure should be the same as the input and the subfolders.

# Usage
